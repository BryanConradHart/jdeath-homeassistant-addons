## About

This addon is based on https://github.com/ArnoldSmith86/virtualtabletop. 

This project aims to create a virtual tabletop in the browser where you can (re)create all board, dice and card games and play them without registration over the internet.

You can host your own instance or go to [VirtualTabletop.io](https://virtualtabletop.io).
